## Welcome to my profile <3
My name is Laisson Bruno, and I'm a Software developer with 10+ years of experience.

I am a frontend developer with over a decade of experience, since January 2010. Throughout these years, I have worked as a freelancer, which has provided me with a wide range of experiences and opportunities to enhance my skills.

I began my journey using tools such as Corel Draw, Flash, Dreamweaver, Photoshop, FrontPage, HTML, PHP, and Fireworks. Back then, these tools were popular and played a fundamental role in developing interactive interfaces and websites.

As time went by, I kept up with the industry's evolution and adapted to the constantly changing demands of the market. Currently, my focus is primarily on technologies like React, Node, and Tailwind CSS. These modern tools allow me to create dynamic and responsive web interfaces, offering users a seamless and enjoyable experience.

In addition to frontend development, I have also had the opportunity to get involved in additional aspects of a project, such as UI/UX and even parts of server-side development. This has allowed me to expand my skills and become a full stack developer.

My skills include knowledge and experience in OKR, Lean Agile, Scrum, and Kanban, as well as project and team management. I have experience in troubleshooting, bug fixing, and understanding of best frontend development practices and design patterns.

Stacks: PHP · WordPress · API · HTML5 · CSS · SASS · Web Development · JavaScript · React · Node · Typescript

I have completed several professional development courses, including "Web Development," "HTML and CSS," "UI Design," and "Web Designer." These courses have provided me with in-depth knowledge in web development, user interface design, and best practices in the field.

I am constantly seeking to update and expand my skills to keep up with the latest industry trends and innovations. I am passionate about creating exceptional digital experiences and I am always eager to take on new challenges.

If you are interested in collaborating on frontend development projects, project management, or agile teams, feel free to reach out to me. I am open to exciting opportunities and look forward to contributing my knowledge and experience to the success of your project.
